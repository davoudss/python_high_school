Introduction
============

This learning package provides materials for teaching Python 
programming for high school students.

This package consists of two sections:

- ``Lecture 1``: Basic programming using Python
 * ``Bisection`` (``Solution``)
 * ``Hares`` (``solution``)
 * ``Mandelbrot`` (``solution``)
- ``Lecture 2``: Advanced programming using Python
 * ``Derivator`` (``solution``)
 * ``PolyClass`` (``solution``)
 * ``FrequencyResponse`` (``solution``)

Getting started
---------------
Each lecture consists of some homeworks. The solutions to the homeworks are also available here.

.. code-block:: python

   init    % sets up paths 
   make    % ??
